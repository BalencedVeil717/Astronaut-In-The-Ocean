<i>What you know about rollin' down in the deep?<br>
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze<br>
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah<br>
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy<br>
<br><br>
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?<br>
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze<br>
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah<br>
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean<br>
<br><br>
She say that I'm cool (damn straight)<br>
I'm like, "Yeah, that's true" (that's true)<br>
I believe in G-O-D (ayy)<br>
Don't believe in T-H-O-T<br>
She keep playing me dumb (play me)<br>
I'ma play her for fun (uh-huh)<br>
Y'all don't really know my mental<br>
Lemme give you the picture like stencil<br>
<br><br>
Falling out, in a drought<br>
No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down)<br>
See, that pain was all around<br>
See, my mode was kinda lounged<br>
Didn't know which-which way to turn<br>
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt<br>
Energy up, you can feel my surge<br>
I'ma kill everything like this purge (ayy)<br>
<br><br>
Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work<br>
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it)<br>
Everything that I do is electric<br>
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it moving like kinetic, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame<br>
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate<br>
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank<br>
Have you walkin' on a plank, la-la-la-la-la, like<br>
Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray)<br>
Uh, I've been going right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)<br>
Pass the baton, back to them all<br>
Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh<br>
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign<br>
Can you please read between the lines?<br>
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine<br>
They say that I'm so fine<br>
You could never match my grind (true)<br>
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)<br>
<br><br>
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?<br>
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze<br>
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah<br>
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy<br>
<br><br>
What you know about rollin' down in the deep?<br>
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze<br>
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah<br>
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean<br></i>
